# I-Espresso: PE File Generator with Extension Spoofing

**I-Espresso** is a powerful tool designed for educational and security testing purposes, allowing users to generate Portable Executable (PE) files with customizable options. This tool leverages IExpress to package batch scripts into executables, effectively demonstrating how attackers can spoof file extensions to evade detection. 

## **Features**

- **PE File Generation**: Creates executable files from batch scripts using IExpress.
- **Extension Spoofing**: Allows customization of file extensions to disguise malicious payloads.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple prompts to guide users through the process of generating PE files.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Quickly generates payloads with minimal setup required.
- **No Dependencies**: Works natively on Windows without the need for additional packages.

## **Prerequisites**

- **Windows Operating System**

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   
2. **Ensure the batch script you want to package is available in the directory.**
   
3. **Follow the prompts to enter the name of your batch script, the desired executable name, and the extension for the generated file.**

4. **The output will be a PE file saved in the same directory with the specified extension.**
